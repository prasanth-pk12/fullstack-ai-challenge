        Overview of the comprehensive test suite created:

        ## Test Coverage Areas:

        ### 1. Authentication Workflows (test_auth_integration.py)
        - User registration with validation
        - Login/logout workflows  
        - JWT token validation and refresh
        - Role-based access control (RBAC)
        - Password security and validation
        - Duplicate username/email prevention

        ### 2. Task Management with RBAC (test_task_rbac.py)
        - Task creation, reading, updating, deletion (CRUD)
        - User ownership and data isolation
        - Admin vs User permission levels
        - Task filtering, searching, and pagination
        - Data validation and error handling

        ### 3. File Upload Endpoints (test_file_upload.py)
        - Successful file uploads
        - File type validation and restrictions
        - File size limits and security checks
        - Task attachment functionality
        - File download and listing
        - Permission-based file access

        ### 4. External API Integration (test_external_api.py)
        - Mock external API calls (/external/quote)
        - API failure handling and retries
        - Rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns
        - Response caching and timeout handling
        - Authentication requirements for external endpoints

        ### 5. WebSocket Real-time Updates (test_websocket_realtime.py)
        - Basic WebSocket connections
        - Real-time task notifications
        - Multi-client broadcasting
        - Heartbeat/keepalive mechanisms
        - Connection error handling and limits

        ### 6. Performance and Load Testing (test_performance_load.py)
        - /tasks endpoint benchmark (50+ requests)
        - Concurrent access testing
        - Response time percentiles (P50, P90, P95, P99)
        - Memory usage stability
        - Throughput measurements (requests/second)
        - Database query performance scaling

        ## Test Infrastructure:

        ### Fixtures (conftest.py):
        - Isolated test database setup
        - Test user and admin creation
        - JWT token generation
        - Temporary file handling
        - Database session management

        ### Test Configuration (pytest.ini):
        - Async test support with pytest-asyncio
        - Custom test markers (slow, integration, performance)
        - Comprehensive error reporting

        ## Key Features Tested:

        ✅ **Security**: JWT authentication, RBAC, input validation
        ✅ **Reliability**: Error handling, data validation, edge cases  
        ✅ **Performance**: Load testing, benchmarks, memory stability
        ✅ **Real-time**: WebSocket connections and notifications
        ✅ **Integration**: External API mocking and failure handling
        ✅ **User Experience**: File uploads, task management workflows

        ## Test Execution:
        All tests are designed to be comprehensive yet resilient to implementation variations.
        They use appropriate mocking, handle missing endpoints gracefully, and provide
        detailed performance metrics and coverage reports.
